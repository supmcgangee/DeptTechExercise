# DeptTechExercise
 Exercise for Dept recruitment process,

 These are my thoughts as I go though the exercise, some questions you may have may be answered here.
 -
 I started with creating a basic Console App in VS 2019.
 I dont have much planned as of creation, I considered TDD'ing my process, but decided against it due to time constraints.
 -
 Check the Commit History for a timeline of what I implemented.
